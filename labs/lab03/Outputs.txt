1. In the body of the function, return 0;
Compile and run the code
What is the output?

PS C:\Users\varga\onedrive\desktop\cpts122_\lab2> g++ -o unittestdriver unittestdriver.cpp
PS C:\Users\varga\onedrive\desktop\cpts122_\lab2> ./unittestdriver
test squareFunc failed!


2. Modify square so that it returns the square of the given parameter
Compile and run the code
What is the output?

test squareFunc passed!


3a. One of the problems with square is that a significantly large input may result in undesired output.
Add a test to the testSquareFunc that calls square with an input of 47000. 47000 squared is 2209000000 
(note that to enter this number as a literal, you will need to make it a long)
Compile and run your code. Output:

test squareFunc failed!


3b. To combat this problem, we should check the input of square for numbers greater than 46340. 
Since a square can never be negative, return a -1 from square if too large of an input is given.
Modify your test to check for a return of -1 from square
-1
test squareFunc failed!
