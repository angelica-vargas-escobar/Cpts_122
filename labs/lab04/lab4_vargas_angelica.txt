Description: Outputs of lab 4 (debugging).

1) Inspect the variable gcdInput1.

Output: 
(gdb) print gcdInput1
$1 = 10

Does this value match what you entered?
Yes, it does match the value that I entered.

2)
Inspect the variable gcdInput2 as above.

Output:
(gdb) print gcdInput2
$2 = 20

Does this value match what you entered?
Yes, this value does match the one I entered.

3)
Inspect the two parameters and verify they match the values entered.

Output:
(gdb) print inNum1
$5 = 10
(gdb) print inNum2
$6 = 20

inNum1 and inNum2 both match the values I entered.

4)
Step one more time and check the result
print gcdVal (if still in the GCDCalculator function) or print gcdOutput (if in the main function)
What is the value output?

Output:
(gdb) print gcdVal
$7 = 10
